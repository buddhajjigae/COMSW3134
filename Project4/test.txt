***()_<}[Comfortably Numb:
-by Pink Floyd.,.?.

Theer is no pain you are recedig
A istant ship smoke on the horiozn
You are only coming throug in waves
Your lps move but I can't her what you're say7ing
When I was a child
I caught a fleting glimpse
zOut of the cqorner of my eyey
I turned to look but 21it wajs gone
I acnnot put my finzger on it now
The cihld is gronw
The dream is gone
I have467 become comfortbaly numb.
